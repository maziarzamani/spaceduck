## What it does

Launches a headless Chromium browser that the assistant can control — navigate to URLs, click elements, fill forms, read page content, and wait for changes. Uses accessibility snapshots to give the LLM numbered element references instead of fragile CSS selectors.

## Requirements

Install Playwright and Chromium (one-time):

```bash
bunx playwright install chromium
```

The browser tool is automatically registered at gateway startup when Playwright is available.

## How the assistant uses it

The browser tool exposes these actions:

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `navigate` | Go to a URL |
| `click` | Click an element by its ref number |
| `type` | Type text into an input field |
| `snapshot` | Get the current page structure as numbered elements |
| `wait` | Wait for a selector, URL pattern, page state, or fixed delay |

A typical flow:

1. Assistant calls `navigate` to open a page
2. Assistant calls `snapshot` to see the page structure
3. Assistant identifies the right element by its ref number
4. Assistant calls `click` or `type` to interact

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `headless` | `true` | Run without a visible browser window |
| `maxResultChars` | 50,000 | Max characters returned from snapshots |
| `defaultTimeout` | 30,000 ms | Timeout for page actions |

<Tip>
The browser tool is heavier than web fetch. The assistant prefers `web_fetch` for simple page reads and only launches the browser when it needs to interact with a page (click, fill forms, handle JavaScript-rendered content).
</Tip>

## When to use browser vs web fetch

| Use browser when | Use web fetch when |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Page requires JavaScript to render | Page is server-rendered HTML |
| You need to click or fill forms | You just need the text content |
| Content is behind interactions | Content is at a direct URL |
| You need to navigate through pages | Single page read is enough |
