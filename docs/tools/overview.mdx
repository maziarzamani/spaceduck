Spaceduck's agent loop can call tools automatically during a conversation. When the assistant needs external information or wants to take an action, it invokes a tool, reads the result, and continues the conversation.

## How tools work

The assistant decides when to use a tool based on the conversation. You don't need to invoke tools manually — the agent loop handles it:

1. You ask a question or make a request
2. The assistant determines a tool would help
3. The tool runs and returns a text result
4. The assistant reads the result and responds

Tools can chain — the assistant might search the web, then fetch a specific page, then summarize the content. This happens automatically across multiple rounds.

## Tool results are text

All tool results are plain strings that the LLM can read — including errors. There are no structured schemas or silent failures. If a tool fails, the assistant sees the error message and can explain what went wrong.

## Configuration

Tools are configured in **Settings > Tools**. Some tools require external dependencies to be installed before they appear.

| Tool | Requires | Auto-registered |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Browser | Playwright + Chromium | Yes (if installed) |
| Web Search | Brave API key or SearXNG URL | Yes (if configured) |
| Web Fetch | Nothing | Always available |
| Document Scanning | `marker_single` on PATH | Yes (if installed) |

The assistant also has built-in tools for reading and updating configuration (`config_get`, `config_set`) — you can ask it to change settings during a conversation.
