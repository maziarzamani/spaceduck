title: "Web Fetch"
description: "Fetch any URL and convert HTML to clean text — a lightweight alternative to the browser tool."
---

## What it does

Fetches a URL via HTTP and converts the response to clean text:

- **HTML** — converted to readable text (headings, lists, links preserved)
- **JSON** — pretty-printed
- **Plain text** — returned as-is

Much faster and cheaper than launching a browser. The assistant prefers this for server-rendered pages and direct URLs.

## Requirements

None. Web fetch is always available — no configuration needed.

## How the assistant uses it

When the assistant needs to read a web page and doesn't need to interact with it (no clicking, no JavaScript rendering), it calls `web_fetch` with a URL. Common scenarios:

- Reading documentation pages
- Fetching API responses
- Reading articles or blog posts
- Checking content at a URL you shared in chat

## Configuration

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `maxChars` | 20,000 | Output truncation limit |
| `timeoutMs` | 15,000 ms | Request timeout |
| `userAgent` | `Spaceduck/1.0` | User-agent string sent with requests |

## Limitations

- **No JavaScript execution** — won't work for SPAs or client-rendered pages (use the browser tool instead)
- **No authentication** — can't access pages behind login
- **Follows redirects** automatically
- **Truncates** output at `maxChars` to stay within LLM context limits

<Tip>
If the assistant says it can't read a page or gets empty content, the page likely requires JavaScript. Ask it to use the browser tool instead.
