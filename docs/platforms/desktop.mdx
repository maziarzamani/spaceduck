---

The Spaceduck desktop app is a [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app) shell that wraps the web UI in a native window. It supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## What it does

- Runs the gateway as a **sidecar process** — starts and stops with the app
- Provides a native window with OS integration (menu bar, window management)
- Connects to the gateway over `http://localhost:3000`

<Info>
The desktop app is a companion to the gateway — it doesn't replace it. The gateway does all the work; the desktop app provides a native window for the web UI.
</Info>

## Running the desktop app

```bash
bun run dev:desktop
```

This starts both the gateway sidecar and the Tauri window. The web UI loads automatically.

## Building for distribution

```bash
bun run build:desktop
```

The built application is output to `apps/desktop/src-tauri/target/release/`.

## How it connects

The desktop app loads the web UI from the bundled frontend and connects to the gateway sidecar over localhost. The CSP (Content Security Policy) is configured to allow connections to `localhost` on any port:

- HTTP and WebSocket connections to `localhost`
- Font loading from Google Fonts
- Image loading from `data:` and `blob:` URIs

## Current status

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| macOS | Supported |
| Linux | Supported |
| Windows | Supported |

The desktop app provides the same functionality as the web UI — chat, settings, file upload, voice dictation. There are no desktop-specific features yet.
