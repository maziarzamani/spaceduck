Spaceduck has three components: the **gateway** (the engine), and two client surfaces (**Desktop app** and **CLI**) that connect to it. The web UI is served directly by the gateway.

## Gateway

The gateway is the core of Spaceduck. It runs on your machine and handles everything: chat streaming, memory, tools, configuration, and file uploads.

```bash
bun run dev
# Gateway starts at http://localhost:3000
```

### Where data lives

| Data | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Config | `data/spaceduck.config.json5` | Single source of truth for all settings |
| Database | `data/spaceduck.db` | SQLite — conversations, facts, vector embeddings |
| Uploads | `data/uploads/` | Temporary file storage with TTL sweeper |

All data stays on your machine. Nothing is sent anywhere except to the model provider you configure.

### Ports and access

The gateway listens on port `3000` by default. Change it with the `PORT` environment variable in `.env`.

Clients connect over HTTP (config API, file uploads) and WebSocket (chat streaming). Both use the same port.

## Desktop app

The Spaceduck desktop app is a [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app) shell that wraps the web UI in a native window. It supports macOS, Linux, and Windows.

### What it does

- Runs the gateway as a sidecar process (starts and stops with the app)
- Provides a native window with proper OS integration
- Connects to the gateway over `http://localhost:3000`

### Running the desktop app

```bash
bun run dev:desktop
```

This starts both the gateway sidecar and the Tauri window.

<Info>
The desktop app is a companion to the gateway — it doesn't replace it. The gateway does all the work; the desktop app provides a native window for the web UI.

## CLI

The CLI is a thin HTTP client that talks to the gateway's config API. Use it for scripting, automation, and managing settings from the terminal.

### Installation

The CLI runs directly via Bun from the monorepo:

```bash
bun apps/cli/src/index.ts status
```

Or alias it:

```bash
alias spaceduck="bun /path/to/spaceduck/apps/cli/src/index.ts"
```

### Commands

```bash
spaceduck status                          # Check gateway and provider health
spaceduck config get [path]               # Read config (or a specific path)
spaceduck config set <path> <value>       # Update a config value
spaceduck config paths                    # List all config paths and values
spaceduck config secret set <path>        # Set a secret (reads from stdin)
spaceduck config secret unset <path>      # Remove a secret
```

### Examples

```bash
# Check what's running
spaceduck status

# Switch chat provider to llama.cpp
spaceduck config set /ai/provider llamacpp

# Set a Bedrock API key
spaceduck config secret set /ai/secrets/bedrockApiKey

# View all current settings
spaceduck config paths
```

### Connection options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--gateway <url>` | `SPACEDUCK_GATEWAY_URL` or `http://localhost:3000` | Gateway URL |
| `--token <token>` | `SPACEDUCK_TOKEN` env var | Auth token |
| `--json` | `false` | Output raw JSON |

<Tip>
Set `SPACEDUCK_GATEWAY_URL` and `SPACEDUCK_TOKEN` as environment variables to avoid passing flags on every command.
