# Git Conventions

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commits. Format: `type(scope): description`

Types:
- `feat` — new feature or capability
- `fix` — bug fix
- `refactor` — code restructuring without behavior change
- `test` — adding or updating tests
- `docs` — documentation only
- `chore` — tooling, deps, CI, config changes
- `perf` — performance improvement

Scope is the package name without `@spaceduck/` prefix: `core`, `gateway`, `memory-sqlite`, `provider-gemini`, `channel-web`.

Examples:
- `feat(gateway): add WebSocket support with WsEnvelope protocol`
- `fix(memory-sqlite): handle foreign key constraint on facts table`
- `test(core): boost coverage for fact-extractor and error classes`
- `chore: rename project from moonbot to spaceduck`

## Author

Commits in this repo use `hi@spaceduck.ai` as the author email (set via local git config).

## Commit Practices

- **Run tests before committing.** All 101+ tests must pass. Run `bun test --recursive`.
- **Small, focused commits.** Each commit should do one logical thing.
- **Never commit secrets.** The `.env` file is gitignored. Only `.env.example` is tracked.
- **Never commit binaries or build artifacts.** `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `*.db` are gitignored.
- **Don't skip hooks.** Never use `--no-verify`.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` — stable, always passes tests
- Feature branches: `feat/<short-description>` (e.g., `feat/web-ui`)
- Fix branches: `fix/<short-description>`
- Keep branches short-lived. Merge via PR with squash.

## When to Commit

Commit after completing a logical unit of work:
- A milestone (M0, M1, M2, ...) or sub-milestone
- A new feature, test suite, or bug fix
- A rename, refactor, or config change

Do NOT commit half-finished work to `main`. Use a feature branch if needed.

## Pull Requests

- Title follows conventional commit format
- Body has a `## Summary` section with 1-3 bullet points
- Body has a `## Test plan` section
- Reference related issues if any
